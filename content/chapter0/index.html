<p class="calibre4">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just done in two hours what it takes the three of us two days to do.&rdquo; My college roommate was working at a retail electronics store in the early 2000s. Occasionally, the store would receive a spreadsheet of thousands of product prices from its competitor. A team of three employees would print the spreadsheet onto a thick stack of paper and split it among themselves. For each product price, they would look up their store&rsquo;s price and note all the products that their competitors sold for less. It usually took a couple of days.</p>
<p class="calibre4">&ldquo;You know, I could write a program to do that if you have the original file for the printouts,&rdquo; my roommate told them, when he saw them sitting on the floor with papers scattered and stacked around them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After a couple of hours, he had a short program that read a competitor&rsquo;s price from a file, found the product in the store&rsquo;s database, and noted whether the competitor was cheaper. He was still new to programming, and he spent most of his time looking up documentation in a programming book. The actual program took only a few seconds to run. My roommate and his co-workers took an extra-long lunch that day.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This is the power of computer programming. A computer is like a Swiss Army knife that you can configure for countless tasks. Many people spend hours clicking and typing to perform repetitive tasks, unaware that the machine they&rsquo;re using could do their job in seconds if they gave it the right instructions.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Software is at the core of so many of the tools we use today: Nearly everyone uses social networks to communicate, many people have Internet-connected computers in their phones, and most office jobs involve interacting with a computer to get work done. As a result, the demand for people who can code has skyrocketed. Countless books, interactive web tutorials, and developer boot camps promise to turn ambitious beginners into software engineers with six-figure salaries.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This book is not for those people. It&rsquo;s for everyone else.</p>
<p class="calibre4">On its own, this book won&rsquo;t turn you into a professional software developer any more than a few guitar lessons will turn you into a rock star. But if you&rsquo;re an office worker, administrator, academic, or anyone else who uses a computer for work or fun, you will learn the basics of programming so that you can automate simple tasks such as the following:</p>
<div class="book">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p class="calibre4">Moving and renaming thousands of files and sorting them into folders</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="calibre4">Filling out online forms, no typing required</p>

</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="calibre4">Checking your email and sending out prewritten responses</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="calibre4">These tasks are simple but time-consuming for humans, and they&rsquo;re often so trivial or specific that there&rsquo;s no ready-made software to perform them. Armed with a little bit of programming knowledge, you can have your computer do these tasks for you.</p>

<p class="calibre4">This book is not designed as a reference manual; it&rsquo;s a guide for beginners. The coding style sometimes goes against best practices (for example, some programs use global variables), but that&rsquo;s a trade-off to make the code simpler to learn. This book is made for people to write throwaway code, so there&rsquo;s not much time spent on style and elegance. Sophisticated programming concepts&mdash;like object-oriented programming, list comprehensions, <a id="calibre_link-1313" class="calibre1"></a><a id="calibre_link-1405" class="calibre1"></a><a id="calibre_link-1605" class="calibre1"></a>and generators&mdash;aren&rsquo;t covered because of the complexity they add. Veteran programmers may point out ways the code in this book could be changed to improve efficiency, but this book is mostly concerned with getting programs to work with the least amount of effort.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Television shows and films often show programmers furiously typing cryptic streams of 1s and 0s on glowing screens, but modern programming isn&rsquo;t that mysterious. <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre5">Programming</em></span> is simply the act of entering instructions for the computer to perform. These instructions might crunch some numbers, modify text, look up information in files, or communicate with other computers over the Internet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">All programs use basic instructions as building blocks. Here are a few of the most common ones, in English:</p>
<div class="book">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre7">&ldquo;Do this; then do that.&rdquo;</strong></span></p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre7">&ldquo;If this condition is true, perform this action; otherwise, do that action.&rdquo;</strong></span></p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre7">&ldquo;Do this action that number of times.&rdquo;</strong></span></p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre7">&ldquo;Keep doing that until this condition is true.&rdquo;</strong></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="calibre4">You can combine these building blocks to implement more intricate decisions, too. For example, here are the programming instructions, called the <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre5">source code</em></span>, for a simple program written in the Python programming language. Starting at the top, the Python software runs each line of code (some lines are run only <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre5">if</em></span> a certain condition is true or <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre5">else</em></span> Python runs some other line) until it reaches the bottom.</p>
<p><a id="calibre_link-1930" class="calibre1"></a>
<pre class="programlisting">&#x2776; passwordFile = open('SecretPasswordFile.txt')
&#x2777; secretPassword = passwordFile.read()
&#x2778; print('Enter your password.')
  typedPassword = input()
&#x2779; if typedPassword == secretPassword:
&#x277A;    print('Access granted')
&#x277B;    if typedPassword == '12345':
&#x277C;       print('That password is one that an idiot puts on their luggage.')
  else:
&#x277D;    print('Access denied')</pre>
<p class="calibre4">You might not know anything about programming, but you could probably make a reasonable guess at what the previous code does just by reading it. First, the file <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre5">SecretPasswordFile.txt</em></span> is opened &#x2776;, and the secret password in it is read &#x2777;. Then, the user is prompted to input a password (from the keyboard) &#x2778;. These two passwords are compared &#x2779;, and if they&rsquo;re the same, the program prints <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre5">Access granted</em></span> to the screen &#x277A;. Next, the program checks to see whether the password is <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre5">12345</em></span> &#x277B; and hints that this choice might not be the best for a password &#x277C;. If the passwords are not the same, the program prints <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre5">Access denied</em></span> to the screen &#x277D;.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The name Python comes from the surreal British comedy group Monty Python, not from the snake. Python programmers are affectionately called Pythonistas, and both Monty Python and serpentine references usually pepper Python tutorials and documentation.</p>

</div>
<p class="calibre4">The most common anxiety I hear about learning to program is that people think it requires a lot of math. Actually, most programming doesn&rsquo;t require math beyond basic arithmetic. In fact, being good at programming isn&rsquo;t that different from being good at solving Sudoku puzzles.</p>
<p class="calibre4">To solve a Sudoku puzzle, the numbers 1 through 9 must be filled in for each row, each column, and each 3×3 interior square of the full 9×9 board. You find a solution by applying deduction and logic from the starting numbers. For example, since 5 appears in the top left of the Sudoku puzzle shown in <a class="ulink" href="#calibre_link-91" title="Figure 1. A new Sudoku puzzle (left) and its solution (right). Despite using numbers, Sudoku doesn&rsquo;t involve much math. (Images © Wikimedia Commons)">Figure&nbsp;1</a>, it cannot appear elsewhere in the top row, in the leftmost column, or in the top-left 3×3 square. Solving one row, column, or square at a time will provide more number clues for the rest of the puzzle.</p>
<div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-91" class="calibre1"></a>

</div>
<p class="calibre4">Just because Sudoku involves numbers doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to be good at math to figure out the solution. The same is true of programming. Like solving a Sudoku puzzle, writing programs involves breaking down a problem into individual, detailed steps. Similarly, when <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre5">debugging</em></span> programs (that is, finding and fixing errors), you&rsquo;ll patiently observe what the program is doing and find the cause of the bugs. And like all skills, the more you program, the better you&rsquo;ll become.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="calibre_link-1316" class="calibre1"></a>Programming is a creative task, somewhat like constructing a castle out of LEGO bricks. You start with a basic idea of what you want your castle to look like and inventory your available blocks. Then you start building. Once you&rsquo;ve finished building your program, you can pretty up your code just like you would your castle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The difference between programming and other creative activities is that when programming, you have all the raw materials you need in your computer; you don&rsquo;t need to buy any additional canvas, paint, film, yarn, LEGO bricks, or electronic components. When your program is written, it can easily be shared online with the entire world. And though you&rsquo;ll make mistakes when programming, the activity is still a lot of fun.</p>

<p class="calibre4">This window is called the <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre5">interactive shell</em></span>. A shell is a program that lets you type instructions into the computer, much like the Terminal or Command Prompt on OS X and Windows, respectively. Python&rsquo;s interactive shell lets you enter instructions for the Python interpreter software to run. The computer reads the instructions you enter and runs them immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre4">For example, enter the following into the interactive shell next to the <code class="literal1">&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt:</p>
<p><a id="calibre_link-1940" class="calibre1"></a>
<pre class="programlisting">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="calibre1"><strong class="literal">print('Hello world!')</strong></span></pre>
<p class="calibre4">After you type that line and press <span class="smaller">ENTER</span>, the interactive shell should display this in response:</p>

<p class="calibre4">If you can&rsquo;t find the answer by searching online, try asking people in a web forum such as Stack Overlow (<span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre5"><a class="ulink" href="http://stackoverflow.com/">http://stackoverflow.com/</a></em></span>) or the &ldquo;learn programming&rdquo; subreddit at <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre5"><a class="ulink" href="http://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/">http://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/</a></em></span>. But keep in mind there are smart ways to ask programming questions that help others help you. Be sure to read the Frequently Asked Questions sections these websites have about the proper way to post questions.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When asking programming questions, remember to do the following:</p>
<div class="book">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p class="calibre4">Explain what you are trying to do, not just what you did. This lets your helper know if you are on the wrong track.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="calibre4">Specify the point at which the error happens. Does it occur at the very start of the program or only after you do a certain action?</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="calibre4">Copy and paste the <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre5">entire</em></span> error message and your code to <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre5"><a class="ulink" href="http://pastebin.com/">http://pastebin.com/</a></em></span> or <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre5"><a class="ulink" href="http://gist.github.com/">http://gist.github.com/</a></em></span>.</p>
<p class="calibre4">These websites make it easy to share large amounts of code with people over the Web, without the risk of losing any text formatting. You can then put the URL of the posted code in your email or forum post. For example, here some pieces of code I&rsquo;ve posted: <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre5"><a class="ulink" href="http://pastebin.com/SzP2DbFx/">http://pastebin.com/SzP2DbFx/</a></em></span> and <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre5"><a class="ulink" href="https://gist.github.com/asweigart/6912168/">https://gist.github.com/asweigart/6912168/</a></em></span>.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="calibre4">Explain what you&rsquo;ve already tried to do to solve your problem. This tells people you&rsquo;ve already put in some work to figure things out on your own.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="calibre4">List the version of Python you&rsquo;re using. (There are some key differences between version 2 Python interpreters and version 3 Python interpreters.) Also, say which operating system and version you&rsquo;re running.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="calibre4">If the error came up after you made a change to your code, explain exactly what you changed.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="calibre4">Say whether you&rsquo;re able to reproduce the error every time you run the program or whether it happens only after you perform certain actions. Explain what those actions are, if so.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="calibre4">Always follow good online etiquette as well. For example, don&rsquo;t post your questions in all caps or make unreasonable demands of the people trying to help you.</p>

<p class="calibre4"><a id="calibre_link-1218" class="calibre1"></a>For most people, their computer is just an appliance instead of a tool. But by learning how to program, you&rsquo;ll gain access to one of the most powerful tools of the modern world, and you&rsquo;ll have fun along the way. Programming isn&rsquo;t brain surgery&mdash;it&rsquo;s fine for amateurs to experiment and make mistakes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I love helping people discover Python. I write programming tutorials on my blog at <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre5"><a class="ulink" href="http://inventwithpython.com/blog/">http://inventwithpython.com/blog/</a></em></span>, and you can contact me with questions at <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><a class="ulink" href="mailto:al@inventwithpython.com">al@inventwithpython.com</a></span></em></span>.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This book will start you off from zero programming knowledge, but you may have questions beyond its scope. Remember that asking effective questions and knowing how to find answers are invaluable tools on your programming journey.</p>
